      "Opensource collaboration is going to be a big part of the future. To collaborate between a large number of contributors spread around the world, most of the collaboration will happen over text. 1000s of people will want to work on the same documents. Even the brainstorming will happen over docs instead of on calls. BIP is the closest to anything I have seen so far that is leading us towards that future.",
